## Setting
The city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms setting. The story begins in the Yawning Portal, a famous tavern in the city.
    
## Plot
The party of adventurers is hired by a wealthy noble in Waterdeep to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances in the city. The noble suspects a secretive cult operating in the shadows, and tasks the party with uncovering the truth behind the disappearances and putting an end to the cult's activities. The cult turns out to be the beholder crime lord Xanathar's guild, using the cult appearances to throw off the city watch and other factions in the city. The disappearances are part of a ritual to summon a powerful demon to the city as part of Xanathar's poorly-thought-out plan to take over the city. The party must stop the ritual before it's too late. In the final battle, the party must face off against an array of infernal creatures and the awakened giant walking statues that guard the city.
